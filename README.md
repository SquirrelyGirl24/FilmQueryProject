# Film Query Project

### What does it do?
A command-line application that retrieves and displays film data. It is menu-based, allowing the user to choose actions and submit query data. 
The user has 3 options that allow them to pull information from the database to either look up by ID or keyword and an exit to stop.

### How to run the program:
1. Open FilmQueryApp.java in Eclipse
2. Click the "Play" button or right-click anywhere in the code > Run As > Java Application

### Technologies used:
* Github
* Terminal
* Java
* Eclipse
* Maven
* SQL
* MAMP

### Topics used:
1. Interface - Used to ensure the implementing object executed certain commands/methods
2. Objects (Film and Actor) - Used to simulate the objects in the database and assist with the connection to the RDBMS via preparedStatement and resultSet
3. JDBC and ORM - Used as the database where all the films and actors are stored into
4. ToString - Used to simulate text being inputed into the database
5. MySQL - Used to test commands in the database before making a ToString in the application
6. SQL - commands SELECT, FROM, JOIN, ON, WHERE, LIKE to gather information in and display the it neatly from the database
7. Try/Catch to catch SQL errors on the application

### Lessons Learned
1. Exception errors - learning to better read and understand the errors that were thrown. Mostly Spelling errors not matching between classes, but learning how to better follow them to find the mistakes.

2. Formatting toString - something I still want to improve, but this was a challenge at first.
